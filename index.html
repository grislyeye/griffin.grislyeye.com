            <p>A low fantasy campaign of grim deeds</p>
          </header>

          <p>
            <strong>Black Griffin</strong> is a gritty campaign where the
            characters play mercenaries on the wrong side of a war.

          <p>
            It is a new age and bloody revolution spreads across the Midlands.
            Kingdoms have fallen and despots deposed before the revolutionary
            fervour of the New Commonwealth.
          </p>

          <p>
            The remaining nobility have gathered together in an uneasy alliance
            known as The Three Kings. They have spent the last few years
            prosecuting a war against the upstart mob, assembling a massive
            conscript army called The Mandatory Forces. However, they have been
            equally matched on the battlefield by the Commonwealth's own peasant
            army.
          </p>

          <p>
            After years of stalemate, the war has achieved little, and many
            nobles fear they might soon lose.
          </p>

              Our players are mercenaries in the employ of the infamous
              <strong>Company of the Black Griffin</strong>. Lowly even for
              sellswords, they have been placed on punishment duty as company
              fetches: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for
              trial.

            <h4 id="flock">The Flock</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>The Flock</strong> is a ring of Commonwealth spies led by
              the mercurial figure known only as <strong>The Sparrow</strong>,
              they work to counter the machinations of the Three Kings.
            </p>

            <h4 id="mandatories">The Mandatory Forces</h4>

            <p>
              The army of conscripts known as the
              <strong>Mandatory Forces</strong> (or "mandatories") draws
              soldiers from those lands still under the sway of the Three Kings.
              Many are, in fact, loyalist refugees from the Commoner Revolution.
              Morale is low for these grey-liveried grunts and one wonders how
              long they can hold together before they desert <em>en masse</em>.
            </p>

            <h4 id="privy-council">The Privy Council</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>The Privy Council</strong> is the power behind the Three
              Kings. Led by the notorious <strong>Lord Roche</strong>, this
              influential body consists of the minor nobles, generals and
              bureaucrats who struggle to keep the old monarchies running.
            </p>

            <h4 id="thieves-council">The Thieves' Council</h4>

            <p>
              <strong>The Thieves' Council</strong> is a name you only hear in
              whispers, if at all. This secretive alliance presents a unified
              organisation for all thieves, blackguards, scoundrels and rogues
              in Dismas. Most believe it's just a legend, but the word on the
              street is that it is very much alive. If the Council were real, it
              would surely be a tenuous alliance at best, easily broken.

            <h3 id="gods">The Gods, Old and New</h3>

            <p>
              The gods are silent, but their flocks are anything but. The Land
              is dominated by the worship of the New Gods:
              <strong>The Mother</strong> and <strong>The Father</strong>, the
              ancestral parents of humanity. Shrines to The Mother dot the city,
              and the <strong>Holy Temple of the Father</strong> rules in all
              but name under the leadership of the
              <strong>Mad Bishop of Dismas.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The Old Ways</strong> still linger, despite the best
              efforts of the <a href="#witchfinders">Witchfinders</a>. Folk
              still curse the name of <strong>The Bastard</strong>, the
              illegitimate son of the Father. And if the gods are absent, what
              of <strong>Hell</strong>?
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3 id="world">Beyond</h3>

            <p>
              Few folk travel far, and little is known of the kingdoms and lands
              far from Dismas. Here are some notes about what might be found or
              what rumours our characters might hear:
            </p>

            <h4 id="dismas">Dismas</h4>

            <p>
              The City that Eats Itself. A blistering canker on the arse of the
              <strong>Easterly Sea</strong>. A corrupt miser gnawing at its own
              bones. Its streets run black with filth. A wretched beggar on
              every corner.
            </p>

            <h4 id="commonwealth">The New Commonwealth</h4>

            <p>
              Little is known of what has transpired north since the
              <strong>Commoner Revolution</strong> unseated the nobles of
              <strong>Dorshire</strong>. The fledgling Commonwealth has erased
              ancient borders, and reconfigured (even built) entire towns and
              cities. So quickly, the region is nearly unrecognisable.
            </p>

            <h4 id="the-nroth">T'Ill North</h4>

            <p>
              Far north lies a wild land filled with cold climes, and hard men
              and women. Here, warring clans constantly fight over the claim to
              be <strong>King O'The North</strong> and have little time to build
              towns or sow fields. When it isn't being razed, the town of
              <strong>Norton</strong> stands against the chaos as the singular
              bastion of order.
            </p>

            <h4 id="woald">The Grey Woald</h4>

            <p>
              What lies beyond the vast woods of the
              <strong>Grey Woald</strong>? To some, it is a meaningless
              question. The woods are so vast, it is easier to ask:
              <q>What does not?</q> Everything. Nothing.
            </p>

            <h4 id="southron-kingdoms">Southron Kingdoms</h4>

            <p>
              Sunnier climes lie south, but Dismas casts a long shadow. The
              kingdoms and towns here are effectively vassals to the city. Such
              places as <strong>Kastenburg</strong>, <strong>Faro</strong> or
              the <strong>Duchy of Castantis</strong> are held hostage to
              Dismas' insatiable hunger for food, workers and opium.
            </p>

            <h4 id="east">And East</h4>

            <p>
              What lies beyond the cobalt waters of the
              <strong>Easterly Sea</strong>? Countless uncharted lands: the
              golden nation of <strong>Jinibia</strong>, the forlorn isles known
              only as <strong>The Catcalls</strong> and the icy wastes of the
              <strong>Shining Lands</strong>, are to name but a few.
